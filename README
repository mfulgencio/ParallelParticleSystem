Based on CPE 476, Lab 1, Tim Adam & Nick Alereza


compile: 'make'
run: 'make run'
  or './run'

command line args:
-n <int> 	  number of particles to start with (200 default)
-speed <float>	  how fast the simulation should run (1x default)
-size <float>	  the size of the particles (0.05 default)
-random <float>   the size of the box wherein the particles start
                  (0.5 default)
-bounce <float>	  how bouncy the particles are (0.8 default)
                  -> the more bounce, the faster the particles 
                     reflect off the model
-model <string>	  which model to use (path to .m or .obj file)


TODO
Use triangles rather than spheres
   -> change particle model to tetrahedron or triangle?
Use BVH
Parallelize collision detection
   -> maybe also use the GPU to update the particle's location 
      and perform the collision reaction with the player's spheres
Make more efficient use of vertex buffers when drawing particles
